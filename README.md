Voice-Controlled Wheelchair
This project is a prototype of a multifunctional, voice-controlled wheelchair designed to assist individuals with physical disabilities, especially those with impairments in their arms, hands, or legs. The prototype is a small, toy-sized model that demonstrates the core features intended for a full-sized version.

Features
Voice Control: Allows users to control the wheelchair using voice commands.
Joystick Control: Provides an alternative manual control option via a joystick.
Multilingual Support: Recognizes commands in multiple languages, including local languages (e.g., Telugu).
Obstacle Detection: Equipped with ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles and apply brakes automatically for safety.
Purpose
This wheelchair aims to improve mobility and independence for individuals with physical disabilities. By incorporating both voice and manual controls, along with language options, it is accessible to a diverse range of users. The obstacle detection system prioritizes safety during navigation.

Components
Microcontroller: To process voice commands and control motor movements.
Voice Recognition Module: For detecting and interpreting user commands.
Ultrasonic Sensors: To detect obstacles in the wheelchair's path.
Motor System: Drives the wheelchair based on commands received.
Joystick: Provides a manual control option for users.
How It Works
The user issues a voice command, which is detected by the voice recognition module.
The microcontroller processes the command and activates the motors to navigate as instructed.
The obstacle detection system continuously scans for nearby objects and applies brakes automatically if an obstacle is detected.
If manual control is preferred, the user can operate the wheelchair with the joystick.
Future Enhancements
Solar Power Integration: To increase the wheelchair's sustainability and operational time.
Advanced Voice Recognition: For enhanced command accuracy and additional language support.
Enhanced Obstacle Detection: Using multiple sensors for improved safety.
